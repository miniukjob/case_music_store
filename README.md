# Customer & Revenue Analysis Using SQL

This project demonstrates how to analyze customer distribution, sales support workload, and revenue generation using SQL queries on a music store database.

## Project Overview

The goal is to extract key business insights by writing SQL queries that cover:
- Customer assignment to sales support agents
- Customer count per country
- Total revenue by music genre
- Top countries by total revenue
- Summary of customers and revenue per billing country, including average revenue per customer

## Queries Included

1. List all customers with their assigned sales support agent to analyze agent workload.
2. Count total customers per country to understand geographic distribution.
3. Calculate total revenue by music genre to identify top-selling genres.
4. Find the top 5 countries by total revenue from music sales.
5. Summarize customer counts, total revenue, and average revenue per customer by billing country.

## Tools Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / any relational database)
- Sample database: Chinook or similar music store dataset

## Key Insights

- Certain countries have significantly higher customer counts and revenue.
- Some music genres generate more revenue, indicating market preferences.
- Sales support agents differ in client load, which can inform staffing decisions.
- Average revenue per customer varies across regions, useful for targeted marketing.

## How to Use

- Clone this repo
- Run each SQL script in your SQL environment connected to the relevant database
- Modify queries as needed for your own data
